# Car Wash Reservation System

## Project Overview
This project is a Java-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) system for managing car wash reservations. The system allows users to create, cancel, and manage car wash reservations. It also includes functionality for washing center staff to confirm and perform washing tasks.
